# 🌸 Iris Dataset EDA

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the classic Iris dataset. The aim is to understand the dataset's structure, uncover patterns, and derive insights using visualizations and statistical techniques.

---

## 📦 Dataset Info

The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples from three species of Iris flowers:

- **Setosa**
- **Versicolor**
- **Virginica**

Each sample includes the following features:

- Sepal length (cm)
- Sepal width (cm)
- Petal length (cm)
- Petal width (cm)

## 🎯 Objectives

- Load and inspect the dataset.
- Clean and preprocess the data if needed.
- Explore each feature (univariate analysis).
- Analyze relationships between features (bivariate/multivariate analysis).
- Create meaningful visualizations.
- Check for correlations and patterns.
- Document key observations and insights.
